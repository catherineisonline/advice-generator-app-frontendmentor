## About The Project

<p>The perfect project if you're learning how to interact with 3rd-party APIs. This challenge uses the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice.
The challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br>
3. Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Advice Slip API - random quote generator

## What I learned
Another attempt to play around with API and understand it better. Not very hard as I only need one data from get request. This will be my 3rd small project using API. Working with it is not hard however it does get a little harder when I have to work with dynamic DOM elements. Once again was glad to practice some CSS and eventlisteners. I try not to match the original design as much as I did before as it takes more time and I prefer to spend it mostly on JavaScript.

The hardest part which I never managed to finish is saving cache after reload. I tried different ways but I am not getting the final result. I do manage to retrive the previous data (the input value, for instance) however I am unable to make it visible. I usually use console.log-s to understand what I am doing and it does work, I do retrieve everything I need but I have a hard time displaying it on dynamic elements. The elements stay there after refresh however they are empty. I will for sure get back to this project again!
